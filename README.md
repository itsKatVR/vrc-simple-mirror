## Introduction

Simple Mirror is designed for UdonSharp.

## Requirements
A project with the latest VRChat SDK3 Release- can be found below:

[UDON](https://vrchat.com/home/download) (Udon Worlds Latest Release)

[Udon Sharp](https://github.com/vrchat-community/UdonSharp/releases/tag/v0.20.3)

## Installation

1. Install VRChat SDK3, UdonSharp, and latest release of [Simple Mirror](https://github.com/itsKatVR/vrc-simple-mirror/releases/latest)!
2. Inside of the "SimpleMirror" Folder you will find the Prefab.
3. Drag Simple Mirror (Prefab) into Scene.

## How it works
The Mirror System by default will enable "Local Only", the player must choose the "Full" mode to see other individuals.

!Update! Mirror System will now remember which mode you selected after you turn it off!

-To Enable mirror, using UI Pointer- click the "Switch" button. (Power On Symbol)
-To flip through options, select the unselected icon. (Greyed out)


How to Edit:
If you would like to edit mirror size/shape please drag "Full_Unselected" & "Local_Unselected" from inside the parent objects of-
"Mirror_Local" & "Mirror_Full".

Example:

When finished resizing mirror, ensure to drag "Full_Unselected" & "Local_Unselected" back into their default positions.
